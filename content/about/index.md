Hello! I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at Bayer Crop Science (previously Climate Corporation). My daily tasks focus on crafting data transfomers and pipelines for spatio-temporal data from agricultural machinery.

I previously worked as Senior Navigation Engineer at John Deere ISG, where I worked on writing embedded software for high-precision GNSS receivers.

I graduated from Purdue University in August 2021 with a PhD in Electrical Engineering. My past project included [ISOBlue](https://www.isoblue.org/) - a plug-and-play device that helped collect CAN and GNSS logs from ag machinery automagically for my PhD research. I deployed over 10 of them in the field.
