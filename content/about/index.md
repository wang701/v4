Hello! I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at the Climate Corporation. My
daily task involves turning geospatial data collected from ag equipment into
vector or raster data formats for powering visualization and yield reporting on
[FieldView](https://climate.com/en-us.html).

I previously worked as Senior Navigation Engineer at John Deere ISG, where I
wrote embedded C++ code for high-precision GNSS receivers.

I graduated from Purdue University in August 2021 with a PhD in Electrical
Engineering. My PhD research primarily focused analyzing GNSS tracks for
combine harvester activity classification, clustering, and efficiency analyses.
During my PhD, I made several iterations of
[ISOBlue](https://www.isoblue.org/). It connects to ag equipment for collecting
CAN and GNSS logs automatically. I deployed ten of them in the field.

Here are a few technologies I've been using recently:
