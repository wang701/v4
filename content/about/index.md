Hello! I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at the Climate Corporation. I
develop Python packages to turn geospatial datasets collected from ag equipment
into vector or raster formats that are used internally for visualization and
creating yield reports on FieldView.

I previously worked as Senior Navigation Engineer at John Deere ISG, where I
wrote embedded C++ code for high-precision GNSS receivers.

I graduated from Purdue University in August 2021 with a PhD in Electrical
Engineering. My PhD research primarily focused analyzing GNSS tracks for
combine harvester activity classification, clustering, and efficiency analyses.
During my PhD, I made several iterations of
[ISOBlue](https://www.isoblue.org/). It connects to ag equipment for collecting
CAN and GNSS logs. I made and deployed over 10 of them in the field.

Here are a few technologies I've been using recently:
