Hello! I'm Yang, a Senior Navigation Engineer at John Deere Intelligent
Solutions Group. My current interest are architecting and implementing
navigation algorithms for GNSS receivers.

I enjoy building things from ground up, especially handy embedded hardware
and useful software applications. I always strive to solve problems in an
efficient and performant manner.

Engineering. I was the chief maker behind [ISOBlue](https://www.isoblue.org/) -
a plug-and-play device that helped me collect CAN and GNSS logs from different
kinds of ag machinery automagically for my research. I used these data to
perform extensive data analysis and forensics for generating cool
visualizations and ag-related insights.
